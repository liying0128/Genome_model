Genome Metabolite Prediction
This script is designed to predict endogenous metabolites from a bacterial genome sequence. It utilizes gene annotation, KEGG pathway modeling, deep learning, and structure inference to predict and visualize potential metabolites.

Requirements
Python 3.x
BioPython
RDKit
Autogluon
Prokka
Installation
Install the required Python packages using pip:

bash
Copy code
pip install biopython rdkit autogluon
Install Prokka following the instructions on its official GitHub page.

Usage
Replace path_to_your_genome.fasta in the script with the path to your bacterial genome FASTA file.
Run the script:
bash
Copy code
python genome_metabolite_prediction.py
This will execute the prediction process and generate PNG files containing the structures of predicted metabolites.

Functionality
1. Gene Annotation
The script utilizes Prokka for gene annotation. Prokka annotates the input bacterial genome FASTA file and extracts information about coding sequences (CDS).

2. KEGG Pathway Modeling
Based on the annotated genes, the script models KEGG pathways. It maps the annotated genes to known metabolic pathways retrieved from the KEGG database.

3. Deep Learning
Autogluon is employed for deep learning tasks. The script trains a classification model using annotated genes and predicted KEGG pathways as input features. The model predicts metabolic pathways for each gene.

4. Metabolite Structure Inference
For predicted metabolic pathways, the script retrieves corresponding metabolite structures from the KEGG database using BioPython. It extracts the SMILES representation of each metabolite.

5. Visualization
The script uses RDKit to convert SMILES representations into molecular structures. It generates PNG files containing the structures of predicted metabolites.
